# Professorships

## NYU-Shanghaii: TT Environmental Studies     :prof:

NYU Shanghai invites applications for a tenure-track position in Environmental Studies. We are especially interested in candidates at the rank of assistant professor; more senior scholars will also be considered. We seek candidates who have completed a Ph.D. in geography, sociology, anthropology, political science, or a related social science field, and whose work demonstrates a capacity for excellence in interdisciplinary environmental research and high-quality classroom instruction. We are especially, but not exclusively, interested in scholars whose research adopts a global perspective on urban ecology, energy, disasters, or climate change.

Terms of employment at NYU Shanghai are comparable to U.S. institutions with respect to research start-up funds and compensation, and they include housing subsidies and educational subsidies for children. Faculty may also spend time at NYU New York and other sites of the NYU Global Network, engaging in both research and teaching.    

NYU Shanghai is the third degree-granting campus within New York University’s global network. It is the first higher education joint venture in China authorized to grant degrees that are accredited in the U.S. as well as in China. All teaching is conducted in English. A research university with liberal arts and science at its core, it resides in one of the world's great cities with a vibrant intellectual community. NYU Shanghai recruits scholars of the highest caliber who are committed to NYU's global vision of transformative teaching and innovative research and who embody the global society in which we live.

NYU’s global network includes degree-granting campuses in New York, Shanghai, and Abu Dhabi, complemented by eleven additional academic centers across five continents. Faculty and students circulate within the network in pursuit of common research interests and cross-cultural, interdisciplinary endeavors, both local and global.

This includes scholars who have not yet received the Ph.D. and Master’s students. Multiple authored papers are considered as long as the first author meets the above criteria. We cannot accept papers that are already under review at a journal.
